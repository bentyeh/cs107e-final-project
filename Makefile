# A makefile for building CS107E programs composed of C/asm source files.

# Note this makefile assumes that ../cs107e.github.io is the CS107E
# course repository (so it can find libpi modules). You learn
# how Makefiles work in Lab 4.

# Configure compile options via CFLAGS
#  -I           look in this directory for #include files
#  -g        	compile with debug information
#  -Wall     	give verbose compiler warnings
#  -Og       	apply moderate optimization, retain structure for debugging
#  -std=c99  	use the C99 standard language definition
#  -ffreestanding	do not assume presence of standard library (non-hosted)

# you also want that to be built upon calling 'make'.
