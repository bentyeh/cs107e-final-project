## Project Proposal ##

# Name of the project: Raspberry Pi Bongos #

Team members and their responsibilities:
	- Alison Jahansouz - Interrupts, Queue data structure, and timing/looping involved
	- Ben Yeh - graphics library for visual representation
	- Eric Cramer - Analog to Digital conversion for sensors, PWM library, Physical mockup of project

Goal of the project:
	The goal of the project is to make an electronic drumset using the raspberry pi and piezoelectric virbation sensors. We will also create a graphical representation that tracks drum hits on screen. 

Milestone for T-1 week:
	(1) Sensors are working and producing sound, static visuals.

Resources needed:
	- Piezoelectric vibration/knock sensors
	- Analog to digital conversion for the piezo-discs
	- Buttons, one for recording, one for playing back
