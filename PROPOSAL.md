## Project Proposal ##

# Name of the project: Raspberry Pi Bongos #

Team members and their responsibilities:
We will all work on the sound algorithms. 
	- Alison Jahansouz - sound
	- Ben Yeh - sound 
	- Eric Cramer - sensors

Goal of the project:
	The goal of the project is to make an electronic drumset using the raspberry pi and piezoelectric virbation sensors. We will also use electro-luminescent wire to light up when each drum piece is hit. 

Milestone for T-1 week:
	(1) Sensors are working and producing sound.

Resources needed:
	- Piezoelectric vibration/knock sensors
	- Electro-luminescent wire (one color for each bongo/drum piece)
	- Analog to digital conversion for the piezo-discs
	- Buttons, one for recording, one for playing back
